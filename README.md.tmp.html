<h1>HomeDicator - A SenseCap Indicator Firmware using ESPHome</h1>

<p>✨ A customisable SenseCap Indicator Firmware using ESPHome. Design inspired by <a href="https://github.com/Seeed-Solution/SenseCAP_Indicator_ESP32/tree/main/examples/indicator_ha">official example project</a>. ✨</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Supports multiple pages</li>
<li>Each page can have multiple tiles
<ul>
<li>Currently supported tiles are: 
<ul>
<li>Sensor tiles (square &amp; wide)</li>
<li>More will be added in the future</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Settings page to configure screen timeout, 24h clock and screen brightness</li>
</ul>

<h2>Planed</h2>

<ul>
<li>Additional tiles including:
<ul>
<li>Light brightness tiles</li>
<li>Thermostat tiles</li>
<li>Switch tiles</li>
<li>Button tiles</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thermostat view (that can be linked to a tile showing the current temperature and opens on click)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Copy both the <code>sensecap-indicator.yaml</code> and the <code>sensecap-indicator</code> folder into your esphome config folder. <br />
You can have multiple <code>sensecap-indicator.yaml</code> with different names for different devices. <br />
The folder must retain its name and does not need to be duplicated for each device. </p>

<p>Open the <code>sensecap-indicator.yaml</code> and get conformable with its settings. <br />
The following is an example of how to add a sensor to a page (the only functionality currently supported).</p>

<p>Below the sensor block, add the following configuration for each sensor you wish to add:
<code>
- !include 
    file: sensecap-indicator/core/templates/sensor.yaml
    vars:
      hass_sensor_id: "sensor.airgradient_schlafzimmer_temperature"
      esphome_sensor_id: "airgradiant_schlafzimmer_temp"
</code>
<strong>hass_sensor_id:</strong> This is the entity ID of your sensor in Home Assistant. <br />
<strong>esphome_sensor_id:</strong> This is the ID that the sensor will use within ESPHome. It can be freely set but must be unique.</p>

<p>Once you have added your sensors, go to the <strong>ADD / ADJUST YOUR PAGES HERE</strong> section.
A page looks like this:
<code>
- id: first_page
  bg_color: 0x1b1b1b # PAGE BACKGROUND COLOR
  bg_opa: COVER
  widgets:
    - !include
        file: sensecap-indicator/user_interface/templates/page_title.yaml
        vars:
          title: "Bedroom" # CHANGE PAGE TITLE HERE
    - obj:
        styles: content_container
        layout: 
          type: FLEX
          flex_flow: ROW_WRAP
          flex_align_main: LV_FLEX_ALIGN_START
          flex_align_cross: CENTER
          widgets:
            # Your tiles go here!
</code>
You can use this block if you want to add more pages. Make sure that the id is unique and that you update the title.  </p>

<p>To add a tile add the following block below <code>widgets:</code>.
<code>
- !include
    file: sensecap-indicator/user_interface/templates/tiles/sensor_tile.yaml
    vars:
      esphome_sensor_id: "airgradiant_schlafzimmer_temp"
      icon: "\U000F02E3"
      unit: "°C"
      subtitle: "Bedroom"
</code> 
You can change <code>sensor_tile.yaml</code> to <code>sensor_tile_wide.yaml</code> for a tile version that is wide instead of square.  </p>

<p><strong>esphome_sensor_id:</strong> Must match with the ID you used to add the sensor in the beginning. <br />
<strong>icon:</strong> Unicode codepoint of the icon you want to use. See <a href="https://github.com/paviro/HomeDicator/blob/main/ESPHome/sensecap-indicator/core/fonts.yaml">here</a> for icons that are available. <br />
<strong>unit:</strong> Unit of the sensor. <br />
<strong>subtitle:</strong> Subtitle shown below the sensor value.</p>

<p>A screen can hold four square tiles at a time, but you can add more and access them by scrolling down on the Indicator.  </p>

<p>When you have finished adding pages, update the <code>total_pages</code> variable at the top of the file to reflect your total pages + the settings page.  </p>

<p>Make sure to add your device to Home Assistant (it should be discovered automatically) as it will not receive data if you don't.</p>

<h2>A word of caution!</h2>

<p>I build this in my spare time as a hobby. <br />
In general, I make no guarantees that it will work forever, even though I intend to keep maintaining it, but sometimes other things are more important. <br />
I also give no guarantees that updates here will not break existing configurations and require a new configuration - especially now in the early stages this will most definitely happen.</p>
